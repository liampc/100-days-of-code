# 100 Days of Code Log

## Day 1 : 22 May 2020 

Progress: worked on JS calculator project, FCC JS exercises, edabit 

Thoughts: still stuck on calculator project under TOP (The Odin Project). I was able to calculate the first two values but still can't figure out how to do it when it is chained equation. In between, as a break from Calc project, I continued learning from FCC (Freecodecamp) and also did an edabit challenge on loops.

## Day 2 : 23 May 2020 

Progress: worked on my calculator project, did a couple of JS exercises in FCC and did a coding challenge about arrays and keys, learned about Object.entries() method.

Thoughts: still kind of stuck working on Calcular project. fixed some bugs but encountered new ones. I still cant make up a proper system. I still need to improve my thinking and planning process. Tomorrow I'll try to focus more on the step by step process rathen than just keep doing trial and error. 


## Day 3 : 24 May 2020 

Progress: worked on CSS on secret santa project

Thoughts: I do not master CSS but more or less I know the things that I can do, but sometimes I have to google how to do it again, which I think is normal. For javascript, and the whole project basically I need to focus more on planning instead of diving into the project head first. I'll also start reading the Pragramatic Programmer.

## Day 4 : 25 May 2020 

Progress: worked on JS on calculator project, JS basics at FCC. Submit my first pull request on The Odin Project.

Thoughts : I am still stuck on calc project, even though I was able to update some lines, looking at the big picture it does not fit. I am getting frustrated so I decided to look for the explanation online. Later or tomorrow I will read it and go throught it step by step. I feel like the whole planning process is what I should improve upon.  Don't know why I didn't do it earlier with my previous projects, when it serves as a practice for contributing to open source projects.

## Day 5 : 26 May 2020 

Progress: Watch CS50, read about event delegation and calculator project guide, little bit of FCC, 

Thoughts : watched CS50 and since I've been stuck on doing the Calculator project, I decided to finally read a step by step guide on how to do it. Today i learned the concept of event delegation, this is a pattern that can be used instead of creating event handlers for all the buttons for calc.


## Day 6 : 27 May 2020 

Progress: made a big progress on calculator project, continue watching lesson on CS50, did a couple of JS exercises on FCC, read tutorials The odin project.

Thoughts: I was able to succeed in doing 4 pomos in 25 mins in the morning. I progressed a lot on the calculator project because I followed the event delegation pattern, some of the constraints were already solved by me since I've been working on it for a quite a time. 


## Day 7 : 28 May 2020 

Progress: finished main leasson CS50 lesson week 2, did a couple JS exercises in FCC

Thoughts : Today was not as productive yesterday. I find that I am less productive during Thursdays, based on my pomodoro history. Maybe because it is the middle of the week. Tomorrow I'll focus harder.

## Day 8 : 29 May 2020 

Progress: update my calc project, read Odin, do edabit

Thoughts : Read and watch videos about thinking like a programmer, It was really helpful. Learned how to tackle a problem, plan your program and to focus more on algorithms rather than diving immediately into coding, which is the mistake I usually do. Challenge to self: deliberate practice on writing algorithms even on short coding challenges.

## Day 9: 30 May 2020 

Progress : learn more about different patterns of breaking down problem, practice writing down algorithms, do a coding challenge, did couple of exercises from FCC.

Thoughts : Currently I am having a ahrd time doing the planning and breaking down of problems, I dont have any problems on syntax since I know I can always google it, so I am deliberately practicing writing down algorithms. 

## Day 10: 31 May 2020

Progress: deliberate practice on algorithms, review JS Basics and did a couple exercises on algorithms in Freecodecamp. 

Thoughts: Not as productive as I planned to, but I try to not be so strict during Sundays. I did practice on pseudocode even on small coding challenges just to get a hang of thinking systematically. It's quite hard to not jump immediately on coding and doing trial and error, but now I am more aware of it.

## Day 11: 1 June 2020

Progress: do Exercism challenges, review JS, review objects and object constructors. 

Thoughts: I am following the curriculum of The Odin Project and Freecodecamp and I really enjoyed reviewing JS and test my knowledge. I did install and do exercisms challenges and I like doing coding problems locally.

## Day 12 : 2 June 2020

Progress: follow a JS exercise on changing CSS variables, study more about objects and constructors

Thoughts: This day has been really difficuly, not because of the coding but wilth all the things happending around the world and in my country. 

## Day 13 : 3 June 2020

Progress: learn more about object and object prototype. 

Thoughts : Although I am still not completely confident, I now understand more about how when you use methods, its actually accessing the saved methods from objects's prototype. I can't still fully grasp the whole process but I will be starting a new Project called Library for the next day.

## Day 14 : 4 June 2020

Progress: start new project under the Odin Project called Library

Thoughts :  I  was able to the html and CSS for today, and write the plan on how to do it. I want to make it a habit to always write down a pseudocode for the projects I will do.

## Day 15 : 5 June 2020 

Progress: work on Library project, Do ES6 exercises in FCC

Thoughts : Still working on Library project, need to review DOM manipulation. So far I was able to add divs but still cant add book title per div. I try not to dwell too long or get stuck on a project that's why in between I do exercises in FCC. Today I reviewed about var,let,const, and arrow function.

## Day 16 : 6 June 2020 

Progress : DO ES6 exercises in FCC, do coding challenge in edabit

Thoughts : Today has been a very bad day because of personal stuff, I was only able to do atleast 1 of studying/coding before the day ends. I reviwed spread operator, and default parameters. learned about destructuring assigned values on objects. Hopefully tomorrow I could get back on schedule.

## Day 17 : 7 June 2020 

Progress: read book  and watch videos about objects oriented programming

Thougths: Today is sunday, I normally don't do anything related to programming during sundays but since I commited to the challenge I just read a book and watch videos about object oriented programming. Tomorrow will be more productive for sure.

## Day 18 : 8 June 2020

Progress: do Exercises in FCC about object oriented programming

Thoughts : Still quite confused about creating / handling objects. Decided to do the Object oriented exercises in FCC.  So far, I understood the concepts but having difficulties applying it in a project.

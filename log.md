# 100 Days of Code Log

## Day 1 : 22 May 2020 

Progress: worked on JS calculator project, FCC JS exercises, edabit 

Thoughts: still stuck on calculator project under TOP (The Odin Project). I was able to calculate the first two values but still can't figure out how to do it when it is chained equation. In between, as a break from Calc project, I continued learning from FCC (Freecodecamp) and also did an edabit challenge on loops.

## Day 2 : 23 May 2020 

Progress: worked on my calculator project, did a couple of JS exercises in FCC and did a coding challenge about arrays and keys, learned about Object.entries() method.

Thoughts: still kind of stuck working on Calcular project. fixed some bugs but encountered new ones. I still cant make up a proper system. I still need to improve my thinking and planning process. Tomorrow I'll try to focus more on the step by step process rathen than just keep doing trial and error. 


## Day 3 : 24 May 2020 

Progress: worked on CSS on secret santa project

Thoughts: I do not master CSS but more or less I know the things that I can do, but sometimes I have to google how to do it again, which I think is normal. For javascript, and the whole project basically I need to focus more on planning instead of diving into the project head first. I'll also start reading the Pragramatic Programmer.

## Day 4 : 25 May 2020 

Progress: worked on JS on calculator project, JS basics at FCC. Submit my first pull request on The Odin Project.

Thoughts : I am still stuck on calc project, even though I was able to update some lines, looking at the big picture it does not fit. I am getting frustrated so I decided to look for the explanation online. Later or tomorrow I will read it and go throught it step by step. I feel like the whole planning process is what I should improve upon.  Don't know why I didn't do it earlier with my previous projects, when it serves as a practice for contributing to open source projects.

## Day 5 : 26 May 2020 

Progress: Watch CS50, read about event delegation and calculator project guide, little bit of FCC, 

Thoughts : watched CS50 and since I've been stuck on doing the Calculator project, I decided to finally read a step by step guide on how to do it. Today i learned the concept of event delegation, this is a pattern that can be used instead of creating event handlers for all the buttons for calc.


## Day 6 : 27 May 2020 

Progress: made a big progress on calculator project, continue watching lesson on CS50, did a couple of JS exercises on FCC, read tutorials The odin project.

Thoughts: I was able to succeed in doing 4 pomos in 25 mins in the morning. I progressed a lot on the calculator project because I followed the event delegation pattern, some of the constraints were already solved by me since I've been working on it for a quite a time. 


## Day 7 : 28 May 2020 

Progress: finished main leasson CS50 lesson week 2, did a couple JS exercises in FCC

Thoughts : Today was not as productive yesterday. I find that I am less productive during Thursdays, based on my pomodoro history. Maybe because it is the middle of the week. Tomorrow I'll focus harder.

## Day 8 : 29 May 2020 

Progress: update my calc project, read Odin, do edabit

Thoughts : Read and watch videos about thinking like a programmer, It was really helpful. Learned how to tackle a problem, plan your program and to focus more on algorithms rather than diving immediately into coding, which is the mistake I usually do. Challenge to self: deliberate practice on writing algorithms even on short coding challenges.

## Day 9: 30 May 2020 

Progress : learn more about different patterns of breaking down problem, practice writing down algorithms, do a coding challenge, did couple of exercises from FCC.

Thoughts : Currently I am having a ahrd time doing the planning and breaking down of problems, I dont have any problems on syntax since I know I can always google it, so I am deliberately practicing writing down algorithms. 

## Day 10: 31 May 2020

Progress: deliberate practice on algorithms, review JS Basics and did a couple exercises on algorithms in Freecodecamp. 

Thoughts: Not as productive as I planned to, but I try to not be so strict during Sundays. I did practice on pseudocode even on small coding challenges just to get a hang of thinking systematically. It's quite hard to not jump immediately on coding and doing trial and error, but now I am more aware of it.

## Day 11: 1 June 2020

Progress: do Exercism challenges, review JS, review objects and object constructors. 

Thoughts: I am following the curriculum of The Odin Project and Freecodecamp and I really enjoyed reviewing JS and test my knowledge. I did install and do exercisms challenges and I like doing coding problems locally.

## Day 12 : 2 June 2020

Progress: follow a JS exercise on changing CSS variables, study more about objects and constructors

Thoughts: This day has been really difficuly, not because of the coding but wilth all the things happending around the world and in my country. 

## Day 13 : 3 June 2020

Progress: learn more about object and object prototype. 

Thoughts : Although I am still not completely confident, I now understand more about how when you use methods, its actually accessing the saved methods from objects's prototype. I can't still fully grasp the whole process but I will be starting a new Project called Library for the next day.

## Day 14 : 4 June 2020

Progress: start new project under the Odin Project called Library

Thoughts :  I  was able to the html and CSS for today, and write the plan on how to do it. I want to make it a habit to always write down a pseudocode for the projects I will do.

## Day 15 : 5 June 2020 

Progress: work on Library project, Do ES6 exercises in FCC

Thoughts : Still working on Library project, need to review DOM manipulation. So far I was able to add divs but still cant add book title per div. I try not to dwell too long or get stuck on a project that's why in between I do exercises in FCC. Today I reviewed about var,let,const, and arrow function.

## Day 16 : 6 June 2020 

Progress : DO ES6 exercises in FCC, do coding challenge in edabit

Thoughts : Today has been a very bad day because of personal stuff, I was only able to do atleast 1 of studying/coding before the day ends. I reviwed spread operator, and default parameters. learned about destructuring assigned values on objects. Hopefully tomorrow I could get back on schedule.

## Day 17 : 7 June 2020 

Progress: read book  and watch videos about objects oriented programming

Thougths: Today is sunday, I normally don't do anything related to programming during sundays but since I commited to the challenge I just read a book and watch videos about object oriented programming. Tomorrow will be more productive for sure.

## Day 18 : 8 June 2020

Progress: do Exercises in FCC about object oriented programming

Thoughts : Still quite confused about creating / handling objects. Decided to do the Object oriented exercises in FCC.  So far, I understood the concepts but having difficulties applying it in a project. 

## Day 19 : 9 June 2020

Progress: finished Exercises in FCC about object oriented programming, do a coding challenge in edabit, try to do a coding challenge in exercism, watch a cs50 lesson

Thoughts : The challenges in FCC were very helpful in teaching the details about objects and prototypes. I was able to practice and play around with it in the console.


## Day 20 : 10 June 2020

Progress: work on my Library project, review DOM.

Thoughts: Today I was able to add features on my Library project. I revied DOM manipulation that's why I was able to work on my project. Today, I added a loop function that will display the saved books on an array. Also realize that I am more comfortable in using git in tracking my progress. So today is a sucess.

## Day 21 : 11 June 2020 

Progress: continue watch cs50 week 3 on different types of sort, start functional programming in FCC

Thoughts : not so productive day, cant focus and not motivated to do library project. still dont know how to plan or organize using OOP.

## Day 22 : 12 June 2020 

Progress: do librray project, add input forms, save and show the saved book, edit CSS, add set attributes function, do debugging section in FCC, watch video about objects 

Thoughts: made a lot of progress today in Library, althought I'm not sure if I am doing it correctly, I applied OOP. Not completely sure when to use it or just create a separated function. Also I was able to use git productively and more comfortable today,  encountered new type of problem in git and learned how to delete and untrack a file across branches. 

## Day 23 : 13 June 2020

Progress: continue library project, make a function that remove all children nodes, save and display data from input forms, had a problem with git

Thoughts : had a problem with git, almost lost my progess. Encountered detached head issue and diverged branch but was not able to do the right process, I dont know how I end up just copying my code from branch to my master and upload to github. Now I realized how important pushing code to github instead of just saving and committing changes locally. 


## Day 24: 14 June 2020

Progress: freecodecamp basic algorithm scripting

Thoughts: It is Sunday, I barely touched my laptop but I was able to do some exercises on freecodecamp. 

## Day 25 : 15 June 2020

Progress: still working on my library project

Thoughts: Today, I got really excited because I was able add another working feauture but then realized that I made a mistake on the earlier functions, creating a ripple effect on the following functions. Still having trouble with git when it comes to undoing mistakes so I need to review and practice it. It  I dont really feel frustrated, to be honest it is quite enjoyable and little bit reassuring that I really enjoy doing this, despite making little progress everyday and having a lot of setbacks. 



## Day 26: 16 June 2020

Progress: clean code in Library project, learn git commands on fixing mistakes and undoing commits 

Thoughts: Today, I was able to make my code more readable and cleaner in a new branch but I end up not yet fixing the main issue when it comes to showing the saved books on the library. Still floundering on git but now I am more familliar on what to do when I made a mistake. Also drabbled in working with nodes and nodelist and its difference with array.

 ## Day 27 : 17 June 2020

 Progess: still working on library project, practice git revision

 Thoughts: still cant fix the main issue but I end up making other functions cleaner. I am getting more familliar with git and github, so now I'm not that nervous to experiment thinking that I could always go back and revise


 ## Day 28 : 18 June 2020

 Progress: library project use of event delegation on remove card function

 Thoughts : Not feeling well today, It difficult to focus when you are physically unwell. I tried to fix the main issue of my library project but I only end up fixing the remove card function using a cleaner code thru event delegation. 

## Day 29 : 19 June 2020

Progress: Just watched a tutorial from FCC

Thoughts: got sick having difficulties focusing on working on any project

## Day 30: 21 June 2020

Progress: just made a simple counter in codepen

Thoughts: skipped for the first time yesterday, I got terribly sick that I just slept for almost the whole day. Today is Sunday, I want to do somthing simple so I just made a simple increase decrease counter in codepen just to use simple js solution. I thought it was too simple for me but while making it I actually made little mistakes and insisted on copying what I remember from thhe FCC tutorial instead of trusting my knowlege even though it was right 

## Day 31: 22 June 2020

Progress: watch a JS30 tutorial and do my version of flex grid from scratch

Thoughts: I decided to set aside my library project for now from Odin Project because I am having a hard time and tend to get stuck. I'm not really fond of just watching tutorials because I feel i'm "cheating", so I skipped it but then realized I am missing a lot of things. Now, I just decided that I will watch tutorial videos but I will do everything from scratch instead of just plugging the missing code or the code that I have to solve.


## Day 32: 23 June 2020

Progress: practice CSS, read Think Like a programmer

Thoughts: Not as productice today, just practice CSS. I'm not yet comfortable using loops and do practice problem from Think Like a programmer. I was able to finally do and understand more the process of breaking down problems.

## Day 33: 24 June 2020

Progress: make an app that searches for the country codes

Thoughts: learn fetch data from a json file, practice using regex, practice using filter and map. I learned a new way to display new divs without manually adding attributes properties using the DOM. Hopefully it can be applied to my Library project. Tomorrow I'll try to apply it.

## Day 34 : 25 June 2020

Progress: redesign html and css of Library project, do Basic scripting and fucntional programming exercises in FCC

Thoughts: not really productive today, I wasn't really excited in fixing CSS. I think I will be able to apply the practices that I learned from the country codes project in my Library so I decided to get back to it.

## Day 35 : 26 June 2020 

Progess: worked on library project

Thoughts: Today is very satisfying, as I've thought, I was able to apply the methods from my previous project in my Library project. Today, I also realized how I'm not doing the OOP right in my first tries. I realized I'm not really pushing the data into the array correctly. I also realized how NOT to DOM, when adding list or divs into the html. With this, I was able to reduce my code to almost half of the earlier versions that I made.

## Day 36 : 27 June 2020

Progress: finish the Library project 

Thoughts : Yay! I finished my Library project on Odin Project, there are still room for improvement especially on the CSS part but I want to finish the JS and do other projects. 

## Day 37: 28 June 2020

Progress: read book about Code in general

Thoughts: Today is Sunday, barely touched my laptop but I want to read something casual, related to programming so I read this book called Code that describes how computers came to be. 

## Day 38: 29 June 2020

Progress: Read odin articles on factory functions

Thoughts : Not that productive but was relieved that there are other designs or way of writing code beside from the OOP and learned about factory functions. So far I like the practice of making smaller functions and then using callbacks. Even though i'm not yet completely good at it, I want to make a more efficient code

## Day 39 : 30 June 2020

Progress: read Odin articles on scopes 

Thoughts: learned about call(), apply(), bind() and module design functions. Also learned the technique of saving the scope of "this" into variable "that". I learned different concepts today but not yet sure how to apply it correctly.

## Day 40 :  1 July 2020

Progress: add checkboxes feature on my library project. Still studying and experimenting about factory functions and private functions 

## Day 41 : 2 July 2020

Progress: Watch / study about Modular JS, still grasping functional programming concepts

## Day 42 : 3 July 2020

Progress: did exercises on FCC on functional programming 


## Day 43 : 4 July 2020

Progress: sitll studying and figuring out JS module

Thougths: It's so satisfying to watch tutorials and learn how to make your code organized and cleaner. Excited to get better at it 

## Day 44 : 5 July 2020

Progress: It's Sunday, review JS in sololearn app from phone

## Day 45 : 6 July 2020

Progress: Do exercises on functional programming on freecodecamp

Thoughts: little bit rusty in using map(), filter() and reduce(). I am having a hard time doing exercises in FCC because it is more on "plugging" codes instead of making one for myself

## Day 46 : 7 July 2020

Progress: Start tictactoe project

Thoughts: Today is really fun, started tictactoe project to practice factory function and module pattern. It's exciting to see my code cleaner compared to my previous projects. Hope I'm doing it correctly

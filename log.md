##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

100 Days of Code Log

** Day 1 : 22 May 2020 **

Progress: worked on JS calculator project, FCC JS exercises, edabit 

Thoughts: still stuck on calculator project under TOP (The Odin Project). I was able to calculate the first two values but still can't figure out how to do it when it is chained equation. In between, as a break from Calc project, I continued learning from FCC (Freecodecamp) and also did an edabit challenge on loops.

** Day 2 : 23 May 2020 ** 

Progress: worked on my calculator project, did a couple of JS exercises in FCC and did a coding challenge about arrays and keys, learned about Object.entries() method.

Thoughts: still kind of stuck working on Calcular project. fixed some bugs but encountered new ones. I still cant make up a proper system. I still need to improve my thinking and planning process. Tomorrow I'll try to focus more on the step by step process rathen than just keep doing trial and error. 


** Day 3 : 24 May 2020 **

Progress: worked on CSS on secret santa project

Thoughts: I do not master CSS but more or less I know the things that I can do, but sometimes I have to google how to do it again, which I think is normal. For javascript, and the whole project basically I need to focus more on planning instead of diving into the project head first. I'll also start reading the Pragramatic Programmer.

** Day 4 : 25 May 2020 **

Progress: worked on JS on calculator project, JS basics at FCC. Submit my first pull request on The Odin Project.

Thoughts : I am still stuck on calc project, even though I was able to update some lines, looking at the big picture it does not fit. I am getting frustrated so I decided to look for the explanation online. Later or tomorrow I will read it and go throught it step by step. I feel like the whole planning process is what I should improve upon.  Don't know why I didn't do it earlier with my previous projects, when it serves as a practice for contributing to open source projects.

# 100 Days of Code Log

## Day 1 : 22 May 2020 

Progress: worked on JS calculator project, FCC JS exercises, edabit 

Thoughts: still stuck on calculator project under TOP (The Odin Project). I was able to calculate the first two values but still can't figure out how to do it when it is chained equation. In between, as a break from Calc project, I continued learning from FCC (Freecodecamp) and also did an edabit challenge on loops.

## Day 2 : 23 May 2020 

Progress: worked on my calculator project, did a couple of JS exercises in FCC and did a coding challenge about arrays and keys, learned about Object.entries() method.

Thoughts: still kind of stuck working on Calcular project. fixed some bugs but encountered new ones. I still cant make up a proper system. I still need to improve my thinking and planning process. Tomorrow I'll try to focus more on the step by step process rathen than just keep doing trial and error. 


## Day 3 : 24 May 2020 

Progress: worked on CSS on secret santa project

Thoughts: I do not master CSS but more or less I know the things that I can do, but sometimes I have to google how to do it again, which I think is normal. For javascript, and the whole project basically I need to focus more on planning instead of diving into the project head first. I'll also start reading the Pragramatic Programmer.

## Day 4 : 25 May 2020 

Progress: worked on JS on calculator project, JS basics at FCC. Submit my first pull request on The Odin Project.

Thoughts : I am still stuck on calc project, even though I was able to update some lines, looking at the big picture it does not fit. I am getting frustrated so I decided to look for the explanation online. Later or tomorrow I will read it and go throught it step by step. I feel like the whole planning process is what I should improve upon.  Don't know why I didn't do it earlier with my previous projects, when it serves as a practice for contributing to open source projects.

## Day 5 : 26 May 2020 

Progress: Watch CS50, read about event delegation and calculator project guide, little bit of FCC, 

Thoughts : watched CS50 and since I've been stuck on doing the Calculator project, I decided to finally read a step by step guide on how to do it. Today i learned the concept of event delegation, this is a pattern that can be used instead of creating event handlers for all the buttons for calc.


## Day 6 : 27 May 2020 

Progress: made a big progress on calculator project, continue watching lesson on CS50, did a couple of JS exercises on FCC, read tutorials The odin project.

Thoughts: I was able to succeed in doing 4 pomos in 25 mins in the morning. I progressed a lot on the calculator project because I followed the event delegation pattern, some of the constraints were already solved by me since I've been working on it for a quite a time. 


## Day 7 : 28 May 2020 

Progress: finished main leasson CS50 lesson week 2, did a couple JS exercises in FCC

Thoughts : Today was not as productive yesterday. I find that I am less productive during Thursdays, based on my pomodoro history. Maybe because it is the middle of the week. Tomorrow I'll focus harder.

## Day 8 : 29 May 2020 

Progress: update my calc project, read Odin, do edabit

Thoughts : Read and watch videos about thinking like a programmer, It was really helpful. Learned how to tackle a problem, plan your program and to focus more on algorithms rather than diving immediately into coding, which is the mistake I usually do. Challenge to self: deliberate practice on writing algorithms even on short coding challenges.

## Day 9: 30 May 2020 

Progress : learn more about different patterns of breaking down problem, practice writing down algorithms, do a coding challenge, did couple of exercises from FCC.

Thoughts : Currently I am having a ahrd time doing the planning and breaking down of problems, I dont have any problems on syntax since I know I can always google it, so I am deliberately practicing writing down algorithms. 

## Day 10: 31 May 2020

Progress: deliberate practice on algorithms, review JS Basics and did a couple exercises on algorithms in Freecodecamp. 

Thoughts: Not as productive as I planned to, but I try to not be so strict during Sundays. I did practice on pseudocode even on small coding challenges just to get a hang of thinking systematically. It's quite hard to not jump immediately on coding and doing trial and error, but now I am more aware of it.

## Day 11: 1 June 2020

Progress: do Exercism challenges, review JS, review objects and object constructors. 

Thoughts: I am following the curriculum of The Odin Project and Freecodecamp and I really enjoyed reviewing JS and test my knowledge. I did install and do exercisms challenges and I like doing coding problems locally.

link: https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/javascript/

## Day 12 : 2 June 2020

Progress: follow a JS exercise on changing CSS variables, study more about objects and constructors

Thoughts: This day has been really difficuly, not because of the coding but wilth all the things happending around the world and in my country. 

## Day 13 : 3 June 2020

Progress: learn more about object and object prototype. 

Thoughts : Although I am still not completely confident, I now understand more about how when you use methods, its actually accessing the saved methods from objects's prototype. I can't still fully grasp the whole process but I will be starting a new Project called Library for the next day.

## Day 14 : 4 June 2020

Progress: start new project under the Odin Project called Library

Thoughts :  I  was able to the html and CSS for today, and write the plan on how to do it. I want to make it a habit to always write down a pseudocode for the projects I will do.

## Day 15 : 5 June 2020 

Progress: work on Library project, Do ES6 exercises in FCC

Thoughts : Still working on Library project, need to review DOM manipulation. So far I was able to add divs but still cant add book title per div. I try not to dwell too long or get stuck on a project that's why in between I do exercises in FCC. Today I reviewed about var,let,const, and arrow function.

## Day 16 : 6 June 2020 

Progress : DO ES6 exercises in FCC, do coding challenge in edabit

Thoughts : Today has been a very bad day because of personal stuff, I was only able to do atleast 1 of studying/coding before the day ends. I reviwed spread operator, and default parameters. learned about destructuring assigned values on objects. Hopefully tomorrow I could get back on schedule.

## Day 17 : 7 June 2020 

Progress: read book  and watch videos about objects oriented programming

Thougths: Today is sunday, I normally don't do anything related to programming during sundays but since I commited to the challenge I just read a book and watch videos about object oriented programming. Tomorrow will be more productive for sure.

## Day 18 : 8 June 2020

Progress: do Exercises in FCC about object oriented programming

Thoughts : Still quite confused about creating / handling objects. Decided to do the Object oriented exercises in FCC.  So far, I understood the concepts but having difficulties applying it in a project. 

## Day 19 : 9 June 2020

Progress: finished Exercises in FCC about object oriented programming, do a coding challenge in edabit, try to do a coding challenge in exercism, watch a cs50 lesson

Thoughts : The challenges in FCC were very helpful in teaching the details about objects and prototypes. I was able to practice and play around with it in the console.


## Day 20 : 10 June 2020

Progress: work on my Library project, review DOM.

Thoughts: Today I was able to add features on my Library project. I revied DOM manipulation that's why I was able to work on my project. Today, I added a loop function that will display the saved books on an array. Also realize that I am more comfortable in using git in tracking my progress. So today is a sucess.

## Day 21 : 11 June 2020 

Progress: continue watch cs50 week 3 on different types of sort, start functional programming in FCC

Thoughts : not so productive day, cant focus and not motivated to do library project. still dont know how to plan or organize using OOP.

## Day 22 : 12 June 2020 

Progress: do librray project, add input forms, save and show the saved book, edit CSS, add set attributes function, do debugging section in FCC, watch video about objects 

Thoughts: made a lot of progress today in Library, althought I'm not sure if I am doing it correctly, I applied OOP. Not completely sure when to use it or just create a separated function. Also I was able to use git productively and more comfortable today,  encountered new type of problem in git and learned how to delete and untrack a file across branches. 

## Day 23 : 13 June 2020

Progress: continue library project, make a function that remove all children nodes, save and display data from input forms, had a problem with git

Thoughts : had a problem with git, almost lost my progess. Encountered detached head issue and diverged branch but was not able to do the right process, I dont know how I end up just copying my code from branch to my master and upload to github. Now I realized how important pushing code to github instead of just saving and committing changes locally. 


## Day 24: 14 June 2020

Progress: freecodecamp basic algorithm scripting

Thoughts: It is Sunday, I barely touched my laptop but I was able to do some exercises on freecodecamp. 

## Day 25 : 15 June 2020

Progress: still working on my library project

Thoughts: Today, I got really excited because I was able add another working feauture but then realized that I made a mistake on the earlier functions, creating a ripple effect on the following functions. Still having trouble with git when it comes to undoing mistakes so I need to review and practice it. It  I dont really feel frustrated, to be honest it is quite enjoyable and little bit reassuring that I really enjoy doing this, despite making little progress everyday and having a lot of setbacks. 



## Day 26: 16 June 2020

Progress: clean code in Library project, learn git commands on fixing mistakes and undoing commits 

Thoughts: Today, I was able to make my code more readable and cleaner in a new branch but I end up not yet fixing the main issue when it comes to showing the saved books on the library. Still floundering on git but now I am more familliar on what to do when I made a mistake. Also drabbled in working with nodes and nodelist and its difference with array.

 ## Day 27 : 17 June 2020

 Progess: still working on library project, practice git revision

 Thoughts: still cant fix the main issue but I end up making other functions cleaner. I am getting more familliar with git and github, so now I'm not that nervous to experiment thinking that I could always go back and revise


 ## Day 28 : 18 June 2020

 Progress: library project use of event delegation on remove card function

 Thoughts : Not feeling well today, It difficult to focus when you are physically unwell. I tried to fix the main issue of my library project but I only end up fixing the remove card function using a cleaner code thru event delegation. 

## Day 29 : 19 June 2020

Progress: Just watched a tutorial from FCC

Thoughts: got sick having difficulties focusing on working on any project

## Day 30: 21 June 2020

Progress: just made a simple counter in codepen

Thoughts: skipped for the first time yesterday, I got terribly sick that I just slept for almost the whole day. Today is Sunday, I want to do somthing simple so I just made a simple increase decrease counter in codepen just to use simple js solution. I thought it was too simple for me but while making it I actually made little mistakes and insisted on copying what I remember from thhe FCC tutorial instead of trusting my knowlege even though it was right 

## Day 31: 22 June 2020

Progress: watch a JS30 tutorial and do my version of flex grid from scratch

Thoughts: I decided to set aside my library project for now from Odin Project because I am having a hard time and tend to get stuck. I'm not really fond of just watching tutorials because I feel i'm "cheating", so I skipped it but then realized I am missing a lot of things. Now, I just decided that I will watch tutorial videos but I will do everything from scratch instead of just plugging the missing code or the code that I have to solve.


## Day 32: 23 June 2020

Progress: practice CSS, read Think Like a programmer

Thoughts: Not as productice today, just practice CSS. I'm not yet comfortable using loops and do practice problem from Think Like a programmer. I was able to finally do and understand more the process of breaking down problems.

## Day 33: 24 June 2020

Progress: make an app that searches for the country codes

Thoughts: learn fetch data from a json file, practice using regex, practice using filter and map. I learned a new way to display new divs without manually adding attributes properties using the DOM. Hopefully it can be applied to my Library project. Tomorrow I'll try to apply it.

## Day 34 : 25 June 2020

Progress: redesign html and css of Library project, do Basic scripting and fucntional programming exercises in FCC

Thoughts: not really productive today, I wasn't really excited in fixing CSS. I think I will be able to apply the practices that I learned from the country codes project in my Library so I decided to get back to it.

## Day 35 : 26 June 2020 

Progess: worked on library project

Thoughts: Today is very satisfying, as I've thought, I was able to apply the methods from my previous project in my Library project. Today, I also realized how I'm not doing the OOP right in my first tries. I realized I'm not really pushing the data into the array correctly. I also realized how NOT to DOM, when adding list or divs into the html. With this, I was able to reduce my code to almost half of the earlier versions that I made.

## Day 36 : 27 June 2020

Progress: finish the Library project 

Thoughts : Yay! I finished my Library project on Odin Project, there are still room for improvement especially on the CSS part but I want to finish the JS and do other projects. 

## Day 37: 28 June 2020

Progress: read book about Code in general

Thoughts: Today is Sunday, barely touched my laptop but I want to read something casual, related to programming so I read this book called Code that describes how computers came to be. 

## Day 38: 29 June 2020

Progress: Read odin articles on factory functions

Thoughts : Not that productive but was relieved that there are other designs or way of writing code beside from the OOP and learned about factory functions. So far I like the practice of making smaller functions and then using callbacks. Even though i'm not yet completely good at it, I want to make a more efficient code

## Day 39 : 30 June 2020

Progress: read Odin articles on scopes 

Thoughts: learned about call(), apply(), bind() and module design functions. Also learned the technique of saving the scope of "this" into variable "that". I learned different concepts today but not yet sure how to apply it correctly.

## Day 40 :  1 July 2020

Progress: add checkboxes feature on my library project. Still studying and experimenting about factory functions and private functions 

## Day 41 : 2 July 2020

Progress: Watch / study about Modular JS, still grasping functional programming concepts

## Day 42 : 3 July 2020

Progress: did exercises on FCC on functional programming 


## Day 43 : 4 July 2020

Progress: sitll studying and figuring out JS module

Thougths: It's so satisfying to watch tutorials and learn how to make your code organized and cleaner. Excited to get better at it 

## Day 44 : 5 July 2020

Progress: It's Sunday, review JS in sololearn app from phone

## Day 45 : 6 July 2020

Progress: Do exercises on functional programming on freecodecamp

Thoughts: little bit rusty in using map(), filter() and reduce(). I am having a hard time doing exercises in FCC because it is more on "plugging" codes instead of making one for myself

## Day 46 : 7 July 2020

Progress: Start tictactoe project

Thoughts: Today is really fun, started tictactoe project to practice factory function and module pattern. It's exciting to see my code cleaner compared to my previous projects. Hope I'm doing it correctly 

## Day 47: 8 July 2020

Progress: made a lot of progress in  tictactoe project, 

Thoughts: Made mistakes on project and restart but still made a lot of progress, but I'm not really sure how to work on different modules, I am going to watch more tutorial about it. Eithery way today is really fun, I was able to make a module that displays alternate markers  for different players  tictactoe, make use of data-attr and indexes. 

Update! Just realized I made a mistake, I thought I was doing a modular pattern turns out it was just object literal. It's my fault for jumping straight to a  project because I got too excited. Anyways, I dont really feel worried about since I know I can convert my progress into it. 

## Day 48: 9 July 2020

Progress: made the tictactoe work by converting object literal to a module pattern, watch git video tutorial

Thoughts: I was able to convert my work into a module pattern but I had to re-add the code function but function to see the the flow better. I had to watch git tutorials cuz I'm having difficulties in what to do or the workflow when remote repo is in place.

## Day 49: 10 July 2020

Progress: modify my tictactoe code and add features for basic game

Thoughts: watch video about modular JS, still cant figure out how to use and apply subpub function that could make my code cleaner in terms of events handling. The fixing of the rest of the project feels harder, I feel like my code is not yet organized even though it is working. Want to improve my flow of functions.

## Day 50: 11 July 2020

Progress: finished my tictactoe game!

Thoughts: I wasn't able to apply the pubsub function for this project but I'll try to apply it in the next project because I'm still figuring it out. For the meantime I know that my code could improve a lot more in temrs of how clean it is, the flow and the overall design.

link: https://liampc.github.io/ticTacToe/


## Day 51: 12 July 2020

Progress: Study about subpub pattern 
 
Thoughts: finally understood this pattern. I wasnt able to apply it in my tictactoe project because it deals with more advance concepts like import and export which will be tackled the upcoming lessons

## Day 52: 13 July 2020

Progeress: study about classes, tried to convert my library project into class pattern 

Thoughts: Had a hard time trying to convert into a class pattern because I still dont completely understand all the concepts of class and the syntax to connect the functions that I already made.

## Day 53: 14 July 2020

Progress: studdy about classes

Thoughts: I am having a hard time studying about classes. There are a lot of syntax that you can use but I find it difficult to internalize the concepts since it was said that these classes are not really recommended using. Especially since I already enjoyed doing Functional programming over this pattern. Nevertheless I just tried to understand the concepts.

## Day 54: 15 July 2020

Progress: learn about npm, webpack, ES6 modules, start Resto-page project

Thoughts: flooded with info learnign and setting up npm and webpack. There are a lot of new practices that must be done in setting up your work. I unserstood the concepts now but I am still memorizing the process.


## Day 55: 16 July 2020 

Progress: worked ony my resto project, add homepage, menu page, and part of contact page

Thoughts: really enjoyed this day, spent most of the day coding. I dont really find it difficult to do a project and learn concepts on the way compared to reading long articles. Today, I realized that I am making a habit of writing down a pseudocode before coding, even on creating small functions. I was surprised on how relatively fast I was able to check my todos. Hopefully tomorrow I can finish this project smoothly, or just in a way that I dont have to restart just like my previous projects.


## Day 56: 17 July 2020

Progress: finished restaurant project!

Thoughts: really surprised on how I relatively faster  i become when it comes to finishing my projects. In a span of 10 days, I already finished 2 Odin projects. I feel good because I really enjoyed the process and how rare for me to get frustrated while I'm doing it. I think writing down my tasks, even the mini ones really helped. I also noticed how I encountered less problems in my workflow using git. 


## Day 57: 18 July 2020

Progress: learnt about OOP SOLID principles, do FCC, add local Storage in library project

Thoughts: find it quite difficult to read articles and codes to study about OOP principles, instead watch a youtube tutorial about it. I really need to retrain myself to read long codes and articles, my attention span is getting shorter!
Also asked a question on Odin discord, I used to avoid using discord as much as possible but I know I have to improve my soft skills if I really want to be part of this industry.


## Day 58: 19 July 2020

Progress: Start on To-do list project

Thoughts: I spent most of today working on CSS, I want to learn Boostrap but I'm not really sure how that works with the webpack and eveything. I made everyhting through scratch. I dont want to hate CSS but I cant wait to use frameworks or learn about other tools that will help when it comes to UX.


## Day 59 - 63: 20 July - 24 July 2020

Progress: Working on my Todo List project 

Thoughts: Day 6 since I started doing the project, so far it is working but I'm not completely satisfied how I organized my code. Although I was not doing any repetitive code, I dont know if my flow is readable for other people. After finishing the main functions I'll try to ask for someone to review it because the next project is about frameworks and I want to correct the bad habits that I already have. 

## Day 64: July 25 2020

Progress: work on adding localstorage on my todo list, fix minor bugs

Thoughts: had a problem on showing my data, cant stringify object. I'm afraid if ever my way of creating objects from factory functions might be wrong

## Day 65: July 27 2020

Progress: finally able to save data to localstorage, fix bugs

Thougths: My code currently is kind of messy, I know that I can still make it more organize, especially on the event handlers. Currently, I am making sure that all functions and its eventlisteners are working ok. As of now, I just want to celebrate for making it functional.


## Day 66: July 28, 2020

Progress: practice css creating navbar, study fundamentals of web apps

Thoughts: was not that productive yesterday due, was curious about Full Stack open, read the first part about fundamentals of web apps. I understood the lesson but the following ones are too advance for me. I thought I was able to change curriculum, but decided to finish at least the whole javascript section in The Odin Project. 


## Day 67: July 29 2020

Progress: watched CS50 lesson, do image slider mini project

Thoughts: learnt about concept of memory pointers in CS, practice CSS, setting up of project by installing npm packages by creating an image slider. Still having a difficult time doing CSS, its easy to make it work but difficult for me to make it look good. Already have an idea how to create the JS, will try to apply it tomorrow.

## Day 68-69: July 30 - Aug 1 2020

Progress: Introduction to frameworks

Thoughts: Not tht productive between these days. Learn more about different frameworks. Kind of conflicted between react and vue because vue looks a lot more fun and organized but the limited job postings made me decide to study react, and since it is easier to understand vue, I can just study about it if needed or if I want to. I am getting less and less motivated to do Odin project and was thinking of doing the Fullstack open curriculum since it is more focused on MERN stack, with an aim of creating SPAs.

## Day 70: Aug 3, 2020

Progress: Do fullstack part0

Thoughts: Decided to do Fullstack open curriculum yesterday. I still not sure but I just want to find out if I like doing this curriculum more than Odin project. I think the different approach in learning could be beneficial for me because I struggle when it comes to reading/learning new concepts but no trouble in doing projects. I think this course is good for forcing me to grasp concepts rather than just doing the projects, which i tend to do in Odin Project

## Day 71 - 72: Aug 4 - Aug 5 2020

Progress: Do fullstack part 1, do react tutorial 

Thoughts: dabbled in fullstack open, but still had my doubts regarding my trajectory in general. I want to learn python but there are a lot of people saying that node.js is much better in web dev. Anyway, I decided to try python just because I want to, and decided to continue following TOP. I am also conflicted because I think I am interested in data but I know that studying it is different from webdev and most likely need a degree. Decided to learn python while doing TOP since it doesnt hurt to know a programming language, not just a node.js which isnt

## Day 73: Aug 6 2020

Progress: finished tictactoe react tutorial, practice python

Thoughts: Still confused with the workflow in using react, I feel like you have to go up and down, across your components to make it work. Although the process, surprisingly is quite similar to mine, I think vue is more organized but I still want to learn React. Practicing python is fun because it is more straightforward and neat. I think I'm going to try to learn the book so that I could find a job that uses python like web scraping, data mining to see whether I like doing it.


## Day 73: 

finish a react tutorial. Still figuring out the process of using "this", state, and how to pass data using props. Also, learn python because it's so fun 

## Day 74: 

Follow another react tutorial. Practice by recreating my old library project using React

## Day 78 -79 : 
practice react by creating a simple feedback counter and random anecdote generator 


## Day 80 - 81: 
still practicing react. Having a hard time displaying data within nested object. Study python and do coding challenges in between 


## Day 82 - 83: 
focused more on python. Review data types, python syntax, turtle module in "How to think like a computer scientist" interactive book. Set up python dev environment and do coding challenges

## Day 84 - 85: 
More python, study/review  python loops, unit testing, functions using turtle module. Do coding challenges in hackerrank

## Day 86 - 87: 
Finished part 7-8 of How to think like a computer scientist. Practice python syntax, iterations, and learned about manipulating images. Syntax is quite similar to JS but I'm learning more about practices and techniques in problem-solving 

## Day 88-89:

## Day 100: 
Finished #100DaysOfCode! Today I learned about writing tests for functions and classes with python unittest module and using matplotlib for data visualization. Will be back for round 2 after finalizing what to do next 



# Round 2 

## Day 1: Sept 9, 2020

Today I practice creating test programs for functions nad classes in crash course python. In between I practiced python syntax by following "Learn Python the Hard Way" exercises. I also started the data viz project and use the matplotlib by making simple line graph


## Day 2: Sept 10, 2020

Today, I continued with the learning about data viz. I learned how to plot points, change the attributes of the graph, labels, colors. I also learned how to generate random walks to generate random graph of points. 

## Day 3: Sept 11, 2020

Today, I was able to practice using pygal charts and matplotlib. I followed a tutorial on displaying interactive data using pygal by simulating a rolling dice and its frequencies. Get more comfortable in creating classes.

## Day 4: Sept 12, 2020
practice downloading and using data in csv and json format. Used matplotlib to plot multiple data sets, learned how to make line graphs with direct comparisons



## Day 5: Sept 13, 2020
Learned how to use pygal in creating world map figure, practice opening and using json files. The book the im following is outdated, I practiced debugging and solving problems on my own by googling it haha



## Day 6: Sept 14, 2020

Learned how to setup virtual environment in python, learned how to start a django project, use model module by creating class, introduced to a database and how to migrate it.  Yesterday I started following the webdev tutorial in Crash Course Python, I think really enjoyed dealing with data and databases while trying out django, I got excited learning again. 

## Day 7: Sept 15, 2020

I Decided to try CS50 web programming by Harvard, since compared to the book, it explains the foundations and the reasons for doing the steps needed in creating web apps. Today, I practiced using HTML and CSS, learned how to use bootstrap and SASS. Really made the designing faster and less frustrating for me. So far I liked the pace of it, hopefully I would not find it too difficult in the next lessons.

## Day 8: Sept 16, 2020 

Spent the day doing the project for HTML and CSS. Practice using flex and grid. I still cant make my css more organized, I end up doing things repeatedly. Use sass but I not sure I was able to maximize it, especially with the use of variables.


## Day 9: Sept 17, 2020

Finished the HTML and CSS part of project 0. Learned about get method and how name in inputs affects the action of the button. Introduction to django, create new project with different apps, learned how to render html files, link css files, and use logic such as conditionals in displaying code in html. 


## Day 10: Sept 21, 2020

Working on my django project from CS50 web programming. Still getting used to the basic syntax and writing system of django. Was able to work on displayign simple views.

Still working on django project, got confused on how to display url with parameters, took almost a day to find the right question and answer in google. Was able to display pages and make a simple form for search bar.Still figuring out how to filter search results. 

## Day 12: Sept 23, 2020

Working on my django project, there are a lot of things I need to learn to solve this project, reading documentation is a great practice instead of always relying on video tutorials. Today I was able to finish one of the task in which I have to add a new entry in the wiki. Tried to solve the search results with regex and still figuring out how to add value in the textarea in updating entries.

## Day 13: Sept 24, 2020

Finished all my tasks / specification in my django project. I still need to rewrite some of the code and fix hopefully minor bugs, and add style to the pages. One of the biggest achievement for this day is that I was able to fix the search form and apply regex in my function.

Today I worked on my 3rd project. Still having a hard time how to make models and how to create relationship between models.

Was able to finally make the relationship between two of my models. I was able to render the info into the page.

Tomorrow I'll finish the lesson and see if I can finally understood how to do the project.

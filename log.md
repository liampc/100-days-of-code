# 100 Days of Code Log

## Day 1 : 22 May 2020 

Progress: worked on JS calculator project, FCC JS exercises, edabit 

Thoughts: still stuck on calculator project under TOP (The Odin Project). I was able to calculate the first two values but still can't figure out how to do it when it is chained equation. In between, as a break from Calc project, I continued learning from FCC (Freecodecamp) and also did an edabit challenge on loops.

## Day 2 : 23 May 2020 

Progress: worked on my calculator project, did a couple of JS exercises in FCC and did a coding challenge about arrays and keys, learned about Object.entries() method.

Thoughts: still kind of stuck working on Calcular project. fixed some bugs but encountered new ones. I still cant make up a proper system. I still need to improve my thinking and planning process. Tomorrow I'll try to focus more on the step by step process rathen than just keep doing trial and error. 


## Day 3 : 24 May 2020 

Progress: worked on CSS on secret santa project

Thoughts: I do not master CSS but more or less I know the things that I can do, but sometimes I have to google how to do it again, which I think is normal. For javascript, and the whole project basically I need to focus more on planning instead of diving into the project head first. I'll also start reading the Pragramatic Programmer.

## Day 4 : 25 May 2020 

Progress: worked on JS on calculator project, JS basics at FCC. Submit my first pull request on The Odin Project.

Thoughts : I am still stuck on calc project, even though I was able to update some lines, looking at the big picture it does not fit. I am getting frustrated so I decided to look for the explanation online. Later or tomorrow I will read it and go throught it step by step. I feel like the whole planning process is what I should improve upon.  Don't know why I didn't do it earlier with my previous projects, when it serves as a practice for contributing to open source projects.

## Day 5 : 26 May 2020 

Progress: Watch CS50, read about event delegation and calculator project guide, little bit of FCC, 

Thoughts : watched CS50 and since I've been stuck on doing the Calculator project, I decided to finally read a step by step guide on how to do it. Today i learned the concept of event delegation, this is a pattern that can be used instead of creating event handlers for all the buttons for calc.


## Day 6 : 27 May 2020 

Progress: made a big progress on calculator project, continue watching lesson on CS50, did a couple of JS exercises on FCC, read tutorials The odin project.

Thoughts: I was able to succeed in doing 4 pomos in 25 mins in the morning. I progressed a lot on the calculator project because I followed the event delegation pattern, some of the constraints were already solved by me since I've been working on it for a quite a time. 


## Day 7 : 28 May 2020 

Progress: finished main leasson CS50 lesson week 2, did a couple JS exercises in FCC

Thoughts : Today was not as productive yesterday. I find that I am less productive during Thursdays, based on my pomodoro history. Maybe because it is the middle of the week. Tomorrow I'll focus harder.

## Day 8 : 29 May 2020 

Progress: update my calc project, read Odin, do edabit

Thoughts : Read and watch videos about thinking like a programmer, It was really helpful. Learned how to tackle a problem, plan your program and to focus more on algorithms rather than diving immediately into coding, which is the mistake I usually do. Challenge to self: deliberate practice on writing algorithms even on short coding challenges.

## Day 9: 30 May 2020 

Progress : learn more about different patterns of breaking down problem, practice writing down algorithms, do a coding challenge, did couple of exercises from FCC.

Thoughts : Currently I am having a ahrd time doing the planning and breaking down of problems, I dont have any problems on syntax since I know I can always google it, so I am deliberately practicing writing down algorithms. 

## Day 10: 31 May 2020

Progress: deliberate practice on algorithms, review JS Basics and did a couple exercises on algorithms in Freecodecamp. 

Thoughts: Not as productive as I planned to, but I try to not be so strict during Sundays. I did practice on pseudocode even on small coding challenges just to get a hang of thinking systematically. It's quite hard to not jump immediately on coding and doing trial and error, but now I am more aware of it.

## Day 11: 1 June 2020

Progress: do Exercism challenges, review JS, review objects and object constructors. 

Thoughts: I am following the curriculum of The Odin Project and Freecodecamp and I really enjoyed reviewing JS and test my knowledge. I did install and do exercisms challenges and I like doing coding problems locally.

## Day 12 : 2 June 2020

Progress: follow a JS exercise on changing CSS variables, study more about objects and constructors

Thoughts: This day has been really difficuly, not because of the coding but wilth all the things happending around the world and in my country. 

## Day 13 : 3 June 2020

Progress: learn more about object and object prototype. 

Thoughts : Although I am still not completely confident, I now understand more about how when you use methods, its actually accessing the saved methods from objects's prototype. I can't still fully grasp the whole process but I will be starting a new Project called Library for the next day.

## Day 14 : 4 June 2020

Progress: start new project under the Odin Project called Library

Thoughts :  I  was able to the html and CSS for today, and write the plan on how to do it. I want to make it a habit to always write down a pseudocode for the projects I will do.

## Day 15 : 5 June 2020 

Progress: work on Library project, Do ES6 exercises in FCC

Thoughts : Still working on Library project, need to review DOM manipulation. So far I was able to add divs but still cant add book title per div. I try not to dwell too long or get stuck on a project that's why in between I do exercises in FCC. Today I reviewed about var,let,const, and arrow function.

## Day 16 : 6 June 2020 

Progress : DO ES6 exercises in FCC, do coding challenge in edabit

Thoughts : Today has been a very bad day because of personal stuff, I was only able to do atleast 1 of studying/coding before the day ends. I reviwed spread operator, and default parameters. learned about destructuring assigned values on objects. Hopefully tomorrow I could get back on schedule.

## Day 17 : 7 June 2020 

Progress: read book  and watch videos about objects oriented programming

Thougths: Today is sunday, I normally don't do anything related to programming during sundays but since I commited to the challenge I just read a book and watch videos about object oriented programming. Tomorrow will be more productive for sure.

## Day 18 : 8 June 2020

Progress: do Exercises in FCC about object oriented programming

Thoughts : Still quite confused about creating / handling objects. Decided to do the Object oriented exercises in FCC.  So far, I understood the concepts but having difficulties applying it in a project. 

## Day 19 : 9 June 2020

Progress: finished Exercises in FCC about object oriented programming, do a coding challenge in edabit, try to do a coding challenge in exercism, watch a cs50 lesson

Thoughts : The challenges in FCC were very helpful in teaching the details about objects and prototypes. I was able to practice and play around with it in the console.


## Day 20 : 10 June 2020

Progress: work on my Library project, review DOM.

Thoughts: Today I was able to add features on my Library project. I revied DOM manipulation that's why I was able to work on my project. Today, I added a loop function that will display the saved books on an array. Also realize that I am more comfortable in using git in tracking my progress. So today is a sucess.

## Day 21 : 11 June 2020 

Progress: continue watch cs50 week 3 on different types of sort, start functional programming in FCC

Thoughts : not so productive day, cant focus and not motivated to do library project. still dont know how to plan or organize using OOP.

## Day 22 : 12 June 2020 

Progress: do librray project, add input forms, save and show the saved book, edit CSS, add set attributes function, do debugging section in FCC, watch video about objects 

Thoughts: made a lot of progress today in Library, althought I'm not sure if I am doing it correctly, I applied OOP. Not completely sure when to use it or just create a separated function. Also I was able to use git productively and more comfortable today,  encountered new type of problem in git and learned how to delete and untrack a file across branches. 

## Day 23 : 13 June 2020

Progress: continue library project, make a function that remove all children nodes, save and display data from input forms, had a problem with git

Thoughts : had a problem with git, almost lost my progess. Encountered detached head issue and diverged branch but was not able to do the right process, I dont know how I end up just copying my code from branch to my master and upload to github. Now I realized how important pushing code to github instead of just saving and committing changes locally. 


## Day 24: 14 June 2020

Progress: freecodecamp basic algorithm scripting

Thoughts: It is Sunday, I barely touched my laptop but I was able to do some exercises on freecodecamp. 

## Day 25 : 15 June 2020

Progress: still working on my library project

Thoughts: Today, I got really excited because I was able add another working feauture but then realized that I made a mistake on the earlier functions, creating a ripple effect on the following functions. Still having trouble with git when it comes to undoing mistakes so I need to review and practice it. It  I dont really feel frustrated, to be honest it is quite enjoyable and little bit reassuring that I really enjoy doing this, despite making little progress everyday and having a lot of setbacks. 



## Day 26: 16 June 2020

Progress: clean code in Library project, learn git commands on fixing mistakes and undoing commits 

Thoughts: Today, I was able to make my code more readable and cleaner in a new branch but I end up not yet fixing the main issue when it comes to showing the saved books on the library. Still floundering on git but now I am more familliar on what to do when I made a mistake. Also drabbled in working with nodes and nodelist and its difference with array.

 ## Day 27 : 17 June 2020

 Progess: still working on library project, practice git revision

 Thoughts: still cant fix the main issue but I end up making other functions cleaner. I am getting more familliar with git and github, so now I'm not that nervous to experiment thinking that I could always go back and revise


 ## Day 28 : 18 June 2020

 Progress: library project use of event delegation on remove card function

 Thoughts : Not feeling well today, It difficult to focus when you are physically unwell. I tried to fix the main issue of my library project but I only end up fixing the remove card function using a cleaner code thru event delegation. 

## Day 29 : 19 June 2020

Progress: Just watched a tutorial from FCC

Thoughts: got sick having difficulties focusing on working on any project

## Day 30: 21 June 2020

Progress: just made a simple counter in codepen

Thoughts: skipped for the first time yesterday, I got terribly sick that I just slept for almost the whole day. Today is Sunday, I want to do somthing simple so I just made a simple increase decrease counter in codepen just to use simple js solution. I thought it was too simple for me but while making it I actually made little mistakes and insisted on copying what I remember from thhe FCC tutorial instead of trusting my knowlege even though it was right 

## Day 31: 22 June 2020

Progress: watch a JS30 tutorial and do my version of flex grid from scratch

Thoughts: I decided to set aside my library project for now from Odin Project because I am having a hard time and tend to get stuck. I'm not really fond of just watching tutorials because I feel i'm "cheating", so I skipped it but then realized I am missing a lot of things. Now, I just decided that I will watch tutorial videos but I will do everything from scratch instead of just plugging the missing code or the code that I have to solve.
